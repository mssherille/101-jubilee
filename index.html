                        <p>Full disclosure, I am a Beancounter by day, and a Coder by night, the best of both worlds for me. Took up Accounting in college and it has become my career. It was back in high school when I was first introduced to coding and I was immediately drawn to it! But life happens, and I chose one over the other.</p>

                        <p>Fast forward to adult life, I made a commitment to learn coding to fulfill my other dream, which is writing code and making beautiful, functional, and  websites. The road to code has not been an easy trek but is worth every sacrifice. The love and support from my clients have been the most rewarding of all! </p>

                        <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
                        <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to lead, and I make it a habit to stay up-to-date on current best practices.</p>
